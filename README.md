# Wine_Recommendation_System
I have built a Shiny (R) application for a Wine Recommendation System using two datasets:
wine_facts.csv and wine reviews.csv. The datasets are combined, and a dynamic UI allows users
to filter wines based on brand and minimum rating. The resulting DataTable displays relevant
information about the wines, such as brand, categories, name, dimension, flavors,
reviews.rating, reviews.title, reviews.text, and reviews.username.
How it Solves Wine Company Issues:
Improved Decision-Making: The application provides a streamlined interface for consumers to
find the right wine based on their preferences. By allowing users to filter wines by brand and
minimum rating, they can quickly identify wines that match their criteria.
Enhanced Customer Experience: The dynamic UI with real-time updates ensures a user-friendly
experience. Consumers can easily explore and choose wines, leading to increased customer
satisfaction and engagement.
Data-Driven Recommendations: By combining and analyzing the wine facts and reviews
datasets, the application harnesses the power of data to provide meaningful recommendations.
This assists consumers in making informed choices, potentially boosting sales for the wine
company.
Product Functionality:
Brand Selection: Users can choose a specific wine brand from the dynamically populated
dropdown menu. This allows for targeted exploration of wines from a particular brand.
Rating Filter: The application enables users to set a minimum rating, helping them discover
wines that meet their desired quality standards.
Interactive DataTable: The main panel displays a DataTable with columns containing essential
information about the wines, including brand, categories, name, dimension, flavors,
reviews.rating, reviews.title, reviews.text, and reviews.username.
